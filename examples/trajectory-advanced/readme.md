# rs-trajectory-advanced Sample

> In order to run this example, a device supporting pose stream (T265) is required.

## Overview
This sample demonstrates how to import/export the device's map data and get/set static node into the maps. 

## Expected Output
![expected output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/dorodnic/librealsense/trajectory.gif)

The application should open a window split into 4 viewports: top (upper left viewport), front (lower left viewport), side (lower right viewport) and 3D (upper right viewport). In each viewport, a 3D model of the camera and the corresponding 2D trajectory are rendered.
In the 3D view, you should be able to interact with the camera using your mouse, for rotating, zooming and panning.
